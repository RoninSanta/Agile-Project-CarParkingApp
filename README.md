## "Smoove" Parking App ##
- Provides a website that can allow users to search and book parking spaces ahead of time. Parking fees will be caluated on the website prior to checking out.
#### Objective
Drivers no longer have to waste precious time, circling around the parking lot scouring for empty spots resulting in unnecessary traffic congestion.
#### Frame Work
- Uses phpMyAdmin to create **Databases** for individual uses and check the current lot availability in the backend
- Then ``MySQL`` will be used to update the Database to , REMOVE, ADD, LIST the information
